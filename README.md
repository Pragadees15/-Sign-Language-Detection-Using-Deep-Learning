# -Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project uses deep learning to recognize Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures with a CNN model. It processes hand gesture images, applies data augmentation, and optimizes classification accuracy. The model is trained, evaluated, and used for real-time sign prediction. Future improvements include real-time video recognition and mobile deployment.
